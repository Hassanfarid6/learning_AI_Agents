Understanding how to design prompts that drive model behavior, and

Integrating those prompts into apps (like chatbots, agents, and tools) using APIs and frameworks such as LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, or Next.js with OpenAI.

Here’s your personalized roadmap, built step-by-step for a developer like you 👇

🧩 Hasan’s Prompt Engineering Developer Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Concepts (1 week)

🎯 Goal: Understand how LLMs interpret text and respond.

Learn what a prompt, completion, token, and context window are.

Understand temperature, top-p, and max tokens (they control randomness and length).

Practice using system, user, and assistant roles.

Activity:
Try changing temperature (0.2 → 0.9) and note how the model’s creativity changes.

Phase 2: Prompt Design Fundamentals (2 weeks)

🎯 Goal: Learn prompt types and how to control responses.


Role prompts → “Act as a customer support agent…”

Instruction prompts → “Summarize this in 2 bullet points.”

Example-based (few-shot) prompts → Show examples before asking.

Chain-of-thought → Guide reasoning step by step.

Mini Project:
Build a “Smart Prompt Tester” webpage with a textbox where you can try prompts and compare outputs side-by-side.

Phase 3: Structured Prompting & Patterns (2 weeks)

🎯 Goal: Learn frameworks for reasoning and decision-making.

ReAct (Reason + Act) → combines reasoning and actions.

Tree-of-Thoughts → explores multiple reasoning paths.

Reflexion → model reflects and improves its answers.

Mini Project:
Create an “AI Problem Solver” app that shows the model’s reasoning (e.g., math or logic tasks).

Phase 4: Integration with Code (3–4 weeks)

🎯 Goal: Use prompts programmatically.

Learn to call OpenAI / Gemini APIs in Node.js or Next.js.

Use structured outputs (like JSON) for better control.

Explore LangChain or Vercel AI SDK for agentic workflows.

Mini Project:
Build your own “AI Agent” that uses APIs (e.g., a support bot or coding helper).

Phase 5: Testing, Evaluation & Optimization (ongoing)

🎯 Goal: Measure and improve prompt quality.

Create a prompt testing framework (like a log sheet or small dashboard).

Use metrics: accuracy, consistency, and token cost.

Learn RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for knowledge-based bots.

Mini Project:
Make an “AI Prompt Evaluator” tool that stores prompt versions and their performance.

Would you like me to turn this roadmap into a weekly study plan (with resources and small exercises each week)?
It’ll be about 6–8 weeks total — paced for someone already coding in Next.js like you.
