## 🔧 What is a “tool” (in AI)?

A **tool** is a **small helper** that does one job really well (like a calculator or weather app).
Your AI (the “brain”) can **ask** a tool to do that job and then use the result to answer you.

> **One‑liner:** *A tool is a helper your AI can use to get something done.*
