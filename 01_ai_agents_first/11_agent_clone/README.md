# 🧬 Agent Cloning: Create Agent Variants

## 🎯 What is Agent Cloning?

Think of **Agent Cloning** like **copying a recipe and making small changes**. You have a base recipe (your original agent), and you can create variations by changing specific ingredients (instructions, settings, tools) while keeping the rest the same.

### 🧒 Simple Analogy: The Recipe Book

Imagine you have a **base cake recipe**:
- **Original Recipe**: Vanilla cake with basic frosting
- **Clone 1**: Same recipe but with chocolate frosting
- **Clone 2**: Same recipe but with strawberry filling
- **Clone 3**: Same recipe but with different baking temperature

Agent cloning works the same way - you start with a base agent and create specialized variants!



## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### **Shallow Copy Behavior**

| What's Copied | What's Shared | What's Independent |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Agent object** | ✅ New object | ✅ Independent |
| **Name** | ✅ New value | ✅ Independent |
| **Instructions** | ✅ New value | ✅ Independent |
| **Model settings** | ✅ New object | ✅ Independent |
| **Tools list** | ❌ Shared reference | ⚠️ Careful! |
| **Handoffs** | ❌ Shared reference | ⚠️ Careful! |


```python
# ✅ Good: Pass new lists for mutable objects
independent_clone = base_agent.clone(
    name="Independent",
    tools=[tool1, tool2, tool3],  # New list
    handoffs=[handoff1, handoff2]  # New list
)

# ❌ Risky: Rely on shared references
shared_clone = base_agent.clone(
    name="Shared",
    # tools and handoffs are shared with original!
)
```

## 🎯 When to Use Cloning

| Use Case | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Create Variants** | Different personalities from same base |
| **A/B Testing** | Test different settings quickly |
| **Specialization** | Create domain-specific agents |
| **Templates** | Use base agent as template |
| **Experimentation** | Try different configurations |

## 🎓 Learning Progression

1. **Start Simple**: Basic cloning with different names/instructions
2. **Add Settings**: Clone with different model settings
3. **Add Tools**: Clone with different tool sets
4. **Understand References**: Learn about shared vs independent
5. **Master Patterns**: Create agent families and templates

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Use cloning for variants**: Don't recreate agents from scratch
- **Be careful with shared references**: Pass new lists for tools/handoffs
- **Document your base agents**: Keep track of what you're cloning
- **Test your clones**: Make sure they behave as expected
- **Consider templates**: Create base agents for common patterns
